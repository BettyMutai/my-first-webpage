    <h3>The coastal beaches</h3>
    <p>The reason i love the beach is the calming effect i get when all you see is endless blue water that is beautiful and the feeling of the white sand in your toes.</p>

    <h3>The mountain side</h3>
    <p>There is nothing like breathing clean air and being surrounded by nature itself from the mountains, hills and the trees around.</p>

    <h3>Game Reserves</h3>
    <p>In a safari vehicle with the ones you love which in my case is my dear family and getting to see Gods creation other than humans. Getting to see how they realte with one another from the most dangerous to the most puny.</p>
